    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">Across civilizations and centuries, dogs have occupied a powerful symbolic space — as loyal companions in life and as otherworldly intermediaries in death. Many ancient belief systems regard dogs as boundary-crossers, able to move between the world of the living and the realm of spirits. This unique positioning has elevated the dog from domestic pet to spiritual sentinel in folklore and mythology around the globe.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">In Greek mythology, the hound Cerberus is perhaps the most iconic symbol of this role: the three-headed dog stands watch at the gates of Hades, ensuring that no soul escapes the underworld. Rather than simply a monster, Cerberus represents the liminal gatekeeper — a creature trusted with overseeing the transition between life and death.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">Norse myths introduce Fenrir, a colossal wolf whose eventual breaking of chains will signal the onset of Ragnarok, the end of days. Though a wolf, Fenrir’s canine kinship and symbolic ties to fate, chaos, and cosmic reckoning mirror the unpredictable, often ominous, role of dogs in supernatural lore.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">Meanwhile, Celtic tradition viewed dogs not with fear, but reverence. Canines were believed to guide souls into the Otherworld, the Celtic version of the afterlife. Hounds accompanied deities and warriors, serving as symbols of loyalty and protectors on spiritual journeys. Similarly, in Zoroastrian funerary practices, dogs were used in the ritual of sagdid — their gaze was believed to purify the soul and ward off evil spirits during death rites.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">In Mesoamerican culture, the Xoloitzcuintli — a hairless dog breed — was revered by the Aztecs as a guide to the afterlife. The deceased would often be buried with a Xolo to help navigate the perils of the underworld. Here, too, dogs were not merely pets, but essential spiritual companions.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">Whether seen as guardians, omens, or escorts of the soul, dogs occupy a rich supernatural legacy. Their role in folklore across cultures supports the idea that they possess a kind of sixth sense — not just to danger or scent, but to things beyond human perception. This long-standing cultural intuition continues to shape how we understand dogs as not just companions, but co-observers of the unseen.</p>
