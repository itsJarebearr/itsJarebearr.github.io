			<div class="about">
				<p class=textL>The PCRC was founded by a group of dedicated researchers and paranormal enthusiasts with a shared interest in understanding the unique connection between dogs and the paranormal world. While dogs are known for their heightened senses, their reaction to paranormal events remains largely uncharted in the scientific community. Our research group seeks to change that by documenting strange and unexplained behaviors in dogs and investigating whether they may be linked to unseen spiritual forces or energy fields. We approach each case with a combination of skepticism, open-mindedness, and scientific rigor.</p>
				
				<img src="img/aboutus.png" class=homeimg>	

				<p class=textL>Our primary focus is on dogs that exhibit unusual behaviors—such as unprovoked barking, staring at invisible entities, or acting out of character in specific locations. Through controlled studies and real-world field research, we seek to uncover whether these actions are purely instinctual or if they have a connection to the supernatural. </p>
