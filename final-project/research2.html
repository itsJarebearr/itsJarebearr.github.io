        According to the Delaware Paranormal Research Group (DPRG), animals, particularly dogs, are often the first to react to paranormal disturbances, with many reports indicating that pets sense unseen spirits before humans do. Paranormal investigators have documented numerous cases where dogs exhibit unexplained fear, agitation, or aggression in locations suspected of being haunted. These behaviors include barking at unseen entities, reacting with aggression to empty spaces, and even following invisible figures with their gaze.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">In one documented case, a team of paranormal investigators was called to an old Victorian house where the owners had reported frequent ghost sightings. The family's dog, a Labrador Retriever named Max, would bark aggressively at the basement door every night at the same time, despite there being nothing visible to the human eye. EMF readings later confirmed unusual fluctuations in the same area, leading researchers to believe that Max had been reacting to an unseen force.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">The DPRG emphasizes the importance of studying and documenting such behaviors, as dogs may hold the key to understanding the nature of supernatural activity. Some researchers have even suggested that dogs may have an innate ability to detect spirits or otherworldly entities that remain hidden to human senses.</p>
    <p class="researchtxt textL dblspc">As noted by the DPRG, “Animals, especially dogs, are often the first to detect the presence of spirits or paranormal energy. Their reactions, from sudden barking to unprovoked aggression, provide important clues in understanding the unseen.” This aligns with reports from numerous paranormal investigation teams, who rely on dogs as early warning systems during ghost hunts.</p>
