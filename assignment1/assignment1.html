<p>Kate Wagner’s article, <em>404 Page Not Found</em>, touches upon the evolution of the internet, and the cultural implications that occurred. Kate’s article starts off by explaining how she witnessed the internet’s evolution during the late 90’s and early 2000’s. Then she recounts how she came across stickers through instagram stories, and became nostalgic about her myspace days. “There’s another gif with glitzy text that reads “Don’t hate me cuz I’m beautiful,” recalling the emotional trials of my Myspace days” (Wagner). It is clear to me that Kate has a lot of emotional connection with her use of myspace. This is quite the opposite for me as I started to use the internet during the social media boom, where users were using facebook and then transitioning to instagram. The more I read this article, I become more surprised about how the internet and its use change over time. From personal blogs to professional profiles, standardized web design, and corporate use.</p> 
    
<p>The part where Kate talks about the switch from myspace to facebook stood out to me the most, since I never really used either platform. Because I never used either platform I did not know what made myspace so different from facebook. Within the article, Kate mentions that myspace embraced more of a personalized and creative space that is much more akin to the early internet. She then writes how facebook was seen as minimal and user-friendly, prompting most users to make the switch. With that being said, myspace eventually died out and adopted a more minimal web page design we often see today. In addition, myspace removed a lot of content and creations of old users, but some of its remnants are scattered throughout the internet. With that being said, facebook is falling behind today's other social media competitors, and became a “hapless promotion of fake news and hate speech” (Wagner). Despite Facebook's initial success, it’s no longer seen as the minimalistic and professional website that caused users to switch over. In addition, Kate’s experience with her nostalgia being capitalized off these social media platforms, showcases how these corporations and businesses use the data gathered by these algorithms and analytics. For example, Tik Tok now has a shop page and the catalog/feed will correlate with the user’s reels/stories or searches. Users are bound to make a purchase, especially with the bombardment of advertisements that can be seen throughout the app.</p>
    
<p>Kate’s main point of her article is that there is a drawback with clean and minimal interfaces that we typically see today, and that we should preserve and bring back personalization for the internet. Although I do agree that we should preserve the old internet and that there should be a greater degree of personalization for today’s social media and webpages, she also mentions that “Users…must now operate within the hell of beautiful interfaces designed by experts”(Wagner). I would not go to the extent of calling these interfaces hell, as these interfaces are more user-friendly to the general people. Not everyone wants to learn how to program or code just so that they can do something as simple as posting an image. Even Kate acknowledges this by quoting another article saying “Web 2.0 encourages the broader, ever more interconnected amateur web population to upload, share, record, and participate at increasing rates.” With that being said, many users today would view web 1.0 as hell, similar to how Kate views our current era of the web. Having to learn how to code to personalize your profile feels like it would prevent a majority of users from doing so. With all of this considered, it is an unrealistic and high expectation for people to go so far into personalizing their page to the extreme.</p>
    
<p>Overall, the internet transitioned from a personal and creative space, to a central hub for businesses and corporations to capitalize off their users; however, I do believe that it made it more accessible and friendly to the general public. Although I do not agree with Kate calling our current era of the web hell, I do hope that user-friendly personalization can be implemented, especially features that can help impaired individuals.  </p>
