        <h1>Why is Illustration Important : Discovering the field of illustration</h1>

        <p>Industries hire illustrators to convey messages via images because they are effective. This brings us to the next question: what is the difference between a designer and illustrator? I discuss this in depth in another blog post “Illustration or Graphic Design” Here is a brief explanation. The emphasis on story is central to an illustrator’s work. Illustrators often incorporate story into their visuals. For example, illustrators work on long-form projects like children’s books. I bet you’ve probably seen the popular children’s book Where the Wild Things Are. If you haven’t, it’s definitely worth a read regardless if you are a young adult or an adult. It’s a great example of a brilliant illustrator’s depiction of a story images can translate without words.</p>

        <p>Illustrators use their ability to create images focused on building a story. I use the word “build” instead of “tell,” because stories build upon ideas. Often we focus on the action in a story, rather than the idea that stories build upon ideas. Brilliant illustrators use their abilities to build upon ideas that lead to a result and illustrate a story. They create manuscripts, editorial illustrations, and product graphics. Why are these different projects important? They supply us with the different forms of multimedia we consume today. They question our values and help us develop empathy. Illustrators create a lot of the visual things we consume on social media, in books, magazines, and on tv. They even create the patterns that go on our clothing. Life would be a lot more boring without illustrators. </p>

           <h1>The Human Experience and Illustration</h1>
           <h2>Jarred Tupas</h2>
       </header>

     <p>In this day and age of AI genereated text and images, it is important to remind ourselves the value that illustrators, artists, designers, and others bring to the table. As artists we have to separate ourselves from individuals that utilize AI to create images that look on par with human artists. Although these AI generated images can be highly detailed and replicate an artist's style, they will never capture the world building stories and imagination that go into creating such artwork. Stories and art are created from a culmination of life experiences and inspirations, these are experience that not even individuals can perfectly replicate. As you look at these new generated text-to-image art, theres a lack of story and inspiration that come from it. Essentially, AI generated art can only capture a fraction of human art, and what's left is just an uninspired and lackluster picture.</p>
    
    <p>I do not create art just to show it to other people, I create art because I have my own ideas and stories to tell. Ideas and stories that are trapped within my mind, and the only way to release them is by illustrating them or putting it on to paper. Although art is falling victim to our capitalistic society, there will always be individuals who appreciate the human side of art. The side that allows for these ideas to be innovated and go beyond the human imagination. The value of human art will always be beyond a prompt that only generates detail and replication.</p>
